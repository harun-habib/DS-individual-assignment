This project is a simple C++ program that finds the smallest number in a given array. It's ideal for beginners who are learning about arrays, loops, and functions in C++.

##  Overview

- The program defines a static array of integers.
- A function is used to loop through the array and identify the smallest number.
- The result is displayed in the console.

##  How It Works

1. Start by defining an integer array with predefined values.
2. Create a function that takes the array and its size as parameters.
3. Inside the function, assume the first element is the smallest.
4. Loop through the rest of the array.
5. Compare each element with the current smallest value.
6. If a smaller value is found, update the smallest.
7. After the loop finishes, return the smallest value.
8. In the `main` function, print the result to the console.

##  How to Run the Program

1. Save the source code to a `.cpp` file.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Use a C++ compiler (like `g++`) to compile the file.
4. Run the compiled executable to see the output.

## Expected Output

- The program will display the smallest number from the array.

##  Additional Notes

- This example uses a static array, but it can be extended to accept user input.
- The code follows basic C++ syntax and is suitable for educational purposes.
- It's a great starting point for understanding array traversal and comparison.

##  Requirements

- C++ compiler (such as GCC or Clang)
- Works on Windows, macOS, or Linux
