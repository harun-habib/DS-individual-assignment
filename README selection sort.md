# Pointer Sorting Algorithm Using Selection Sort in C++

This project demonstrates the implementation of the Pointer Sorting Algorithm using the Selection Sort algorithm in C++.

## Overview

- **Pointer Sorting Algorithm**: In this algorithm, instead of directly sorting the values, we use an array of pointers. These pointers reference the elements in the original array, and we perform the Selection Sort on these pointers.
- **Selection Sort**: A comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element and places it in the correct position.

## Files

- `pointer_sort.cpp`: Contains the main C++ implementation of the Pointer Sort algorithm using Selection Sort.

## Compilation and Execution

1. Clone the repository or download the `pointer_sort.cpp` file.
2. Compile the code using any C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`).
   
   ```bash
   g++ pointer_sort.cpp -o pointer_sort
